# Joe Profile

This new site is based on netlify platform to deploy the site. I'll be posting the different projects inside this profile.



## Note on deployment
For "functions" functionality is so much easier to install *netlify-cli* and do *netlify init* and *netlify deploy*.
All started working after problems with node_modules packages.
Do netlify deploy after getting the git. For static websites git is excellent, for dynamic sites *netlify deploy* is the way to go.
